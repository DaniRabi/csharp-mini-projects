# 01Knapsack
My C# solution for solving the 0-1 Knapsack problem plus a solution improved upon that one.
The optimal solution is also included.

# CollatzConjecture
The regular and recursive algorithms for finding the number of steps it takes to reach 1 with regards to the rules in the Collatz Conjecture Problem (also known as the 3n+1 problem).

# PasswordCrack
This program is the brute-force method of cracking a password.
The algorithm goes through every possible combination of a password the same length as the input given (which is the password).
If one of the possible combinations is the same as the password, True is returned and then printed.
Otherwise, False will be returned and printed.
The password may include characters between placement 33 and 126 in the ASCII table.
